.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm portshaker
.Nd Maintain a set of ports trees.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl stv
.Op Fl U | Fl u Ar source
.Op Fl M | Fl m Ar target
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility maintains a set of
.Ar target
ports trees containing ports provided by
.Ar source
ports trees.
.Pp
A single
.Ar target
ports tree can contain ports from any number of
.Ar source
ports trees. If a port is provided by more than one
.Ar source
ports tree,
.Nm
will merge the latest version of this port in the
.Ar target
ports tree.
.Pp
As
.Nm
can maintain any number of
.Ar target
ports tree, it is particularly handy if you want to maintain ports trees in a tinderbox.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl M
Merge all
.Ar target
ports trees.
.It Fl U
Update all
.Ar source
ports trees.
.It Fl m Ar target
Merge the specified
.Ar target
ports tree.
.It Fl s
Display the list of configured
.Ar source
ports trees and exit.
.It Fl t
Display the list of configured
.Ar target
ports trees and exit.
.It Fl u Ar source
Update the specified
.Ar source
ports tree.
.It Fl v
Be more verbose and display information messages. Specify twice to display debug messages as well.
.El
.Ss Handling conflics
When merging a
.Ar target
ports tree,
.Nm portshaker
will try to detect inconsistencies and report
.Tn conflicts .
.Pp
Such conflics can occur in two situations:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet
.It
Two
.Ar source
ports tree claim to provide the same version of a single port (they both have the same
.Ar PORTEPOCH ,
.Ar PORTVERSION
and
.Ar PORTREVISION ) 
but they do not provide the same files.
.Pp
In such a situation,
.Xr portshaker 8
will switch to interactive mode and ask you what to do.
.Pp
In order to efectively fix the problem after the merge, you will have to either:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Remove the conflicting version of the port from its
.Ar source
ports tree.
.It
Bump the
.Ar PORTREVISION
of the port from the desired
.Ar source
ports tree.
.El
.It
A port to be merged has a version number going backward.
.Nm
will not merge the port and will emit a warning.
.El
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.Ss Options order
.Nm
will update specified
.Ar source
ports tree and then merge specified
.Ar target
ports trees regardless of the order of the
.Fl U , u , M
and
.Fl m
options order.
.Ss Special behaviour
When executed without any argument,
.Nm
will update all
.Ar source
ports trees and then merge all
.Ar target
ports tree, behaving like when
.Fl UM
options are provided.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width portshaker_debug
.It portshaker_debug
If set to
.Dq YES
.Nm
will output debugging information. This is equivalent to using the
.Fl v
flag.
.It portshaker_info
If set to
.Dq YES
.Nm
will output extra information. This is equivalent to using the
.Fl v
flag twice.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width @@DESTDIR@@/etc/portshaker.conf -compact
.It Pa @@DESTDIR@@/etc/portshaker.conf
Default location of the configuration file containing descriptive information about
.Nm
.Ar target
ports trees.
.It Pa @@DESTDIR@@/etc/portshaker.d/*
Default location of
.Nm
.Ar source
ports tree update scripts.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr portshaker.conf 5 ,
.Xr portshaker.d 5
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
was originally designed to tinderbuild the development version of both mono-2.0 and gnome-2.24 together. Each project used its own merge script
.Ao Xr mono-merge.sh 8 and Xr marcusmerge 8 Ac
but using both at the same time leaded to conflicts.
.Pp
.Nm
has so been developed as a general purpose solution to contributed ports tree maintenance.
