portshaker(8) is designed to maintain a set of FreeBSD ports trees.

For install instructions, please refer to the INSTALL file.  After installing,
you will have to configure portshaker(8) since it is a toolkit and does nothing
out of the box.  Configuration instructions are provided in the distribution
man pages: portshaker(8), portshaker.conf(5) and portshaker.d(5).

IN ORDER TO PRODUCE REPRODUCTIBLE RESULTS, THE PORTSHAKER(8) PROGRAM'S FIRST
ACTION WHEN MERGING PORTS IS TO RESET THE DESTINATION PORTS TREE.  AS A
CONSEQUENCE, IF YOU HAVE LOCAL EDITS IN YOUR TARGET PORTS TREE, THEY WILL BE
LOST (AND SO DO ANY OTHER FILE IN THE DIRECTORY, E.G. VCS CONTROL FILES).


Portions of sources of this tools code have been stolen from the following
files from a FreeBSD 7.0-STABLE box:
  - /etc/rc.subr
  - /usr/share/man/man5/rc.conf.5.gz
